# GromacsGQuadruplex
Gromacs simulations for parallel human G-Quadruplex unfolding

Contains the .mdp, .tpr and .pdb files necessary for the simulation of the human parallel G-Quadruplex employing REMD molecular dynamics.

The file remd_commands.sh contains the necessary instructions for the setup of the replicas, which take the file remd.md as base, simply changing the temperatures.
